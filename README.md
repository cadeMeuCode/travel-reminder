# alura-armazenando-na-web   
    
This is a project developed during the local storage course.  
In which I learned how to store and retrieve data from local storage.  

## ðŸš€ About the course

the course is taught by Pedro Marins, on the Alura platform.  
It was part of a front-end roadmap that I follow.  
  
## ðŸ“‹ Note - the backpack

The backpack designed in the project was chosen by the course directors and not by me.  
The original backpack was designed by ![Tricia Katz](https://codepen.io/triciaakatz/pen/LbWVPj)  
  
## PS  

The explicacao.md is for my personal use.  
but anyone can read it if they think they can add some knowledge.
